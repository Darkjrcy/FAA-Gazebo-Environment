# FAA-Gazebo-Environment
This repository implements a high-fidelity DAA simulation environment for fixed-wing UAVs, developed using ROS 2 and Gazebo. The simulation is designed to evaluate the performance and robustness of DAA algorithms under nominal and risk sensing conditions, including GNSS degradation, ADS-B estimation errors, and multi-intruder encounter scenarios.
